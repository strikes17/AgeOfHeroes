Alejandro tells me that San Cayetano is the saint of employment in Argentina. On the 8th of every month, unemployed people in Argentina go to the church and pray to San Cayetano to get some work. Supposedly 1 million people visited San Cayetano churches last month. Alejandro expects the number to multiple by 1.5 next year.

Specialized saints are so cool.
